# velocity
An Android app for keeping track of your walk durations for your frequent routes.

My first attempt to use an SQLite database, notifications, background runnables, Settings and Google Maps. :)

This is kind of a demo-app as far as it is my first really complex one.
I might release it one day to the play store... in case it becomes useful and sophisticated.
